# ”How would you define hate speech?” - An Analysis on How Formal Education Shapes Individual Conceptions of Hate Speech on Social Media

This repository contains the R and RMarkdown files of my master thesis research for the Master of Data Science for Public Policy at the Hertie School, 2024, examining how formal education shapes individual conceptions of hate speech. It does not contain any data - if you are interested, just get in touch.
 
## Executive Summary
Amidst the concern over hate speech online and its amplification via social media, discourse on the trade-off between freedom of speech and protection of vulnerable societal groups is receiving great attention. But how inclusive is the discussion? Participation in political discourse is also a question of education. To investigate this within the phenomenon of hate speech on social media, the following research question is addressed: How does formal education shape conceptions of hate speech?
Literature suggests higher education correlates with sophisticated yet ideologically defined political knowledge. It is therefore hypothesized that an academic level of education leads to more sophisticated definitions of hate speech and that academic respondents’ definitions are more ideologically defined than those of non-academics. The analysis draws on data from over 19,000 participants across eleven countries, examining hate speech moderation preferences. Using open-text responses, indicators are created to understand how individuals define hate speech in content (what people regard as relevant) and form (how do they express themselves). Statistical tests compare academic status groups, while regression models explore the impact of academic status, also in interaction with political ideology and hate speech experience. Findings show that the definitions of academics are generally not longer or remarkably more readable. However, they tend to define hate speech more intent-based or narrowly harms-based than non-academics. Academics with higher political interest and left-leaning ideologies provide longer and more readable definitions as those with lower interest and further to the right, while there is no clear pattern for non-academics in either context. This supports the assumption that political attitudes play a greater role in defining hate speech for academics than for non-academics.
